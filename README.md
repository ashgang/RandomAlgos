# RandomAlgos
This repo contains all the random programs and algorithms that I try to learn.  The Python folder contains short programs written when learning python.
The root folder consists of mostly algos and other programs implemented in C and compiled and tested in Linux.

1. expr_eval.c - This is a short program for expression evaluation using two stacks.  Run the program and check for how the input should be given.
