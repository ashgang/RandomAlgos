# RandomAlgos
This repo contains all the random programs and algorithms that I try to learn.  The Python folder contains short programs written when learning python.
The root folder consists of mostly algos and other programs implemented in C and compiled and tested in Linux.  Some programs have a real story behind why it was written, that which you can read and enjoy below.

1. expr\_eval.c - This is a short program for expression evaluation using two stacks.  Run the program and check for how the input should be given.
	- During my bachelor's, for the C course this was the program I had to write for final practicals evaluation.  Unfortunately those were days I wasn't much interested in programming, and I somehow managed to get the output.  After years of being a sw engg, I thought I must write this program to see how easy it is to write it now.  And hence the program.
2. Below are the programs that were written when I had doubts that I forgot the basics.  These programs remind me that I still remember some basic stuff, and give me a chance to look back, if I ever feel that I forget the basics. 
Hey to forget is human... if you don't forget stuff once in a while... hmmmm... you are a bot!
	basicLnLst.c
	fnPtrUsage.c
	queue_lnlst.c
	semThdEg.c
	stack_arrays.c
	thisPtrUsage.cpp
	basicTh.c - First thread program I wrote after eons!
	basicFork_ChdOrph.c - Check the program comments for some information
	basicFork_ParentWaitin.c - Check the program comments for some information
