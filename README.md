# RandomAlgos
This repo contains all the random programs and algorithms that I try to learn.  The Python folder contains short programs written when learning python.
The root folder consists of mostly algos and other programs implemented in C and compiled and tested in Linux.  Some programs have a real story behind why it was written, that which you can read and enjoy below.

1. expr_eval.c - This is a short program for expression evaluation using two stacks.  Run the program and check for how the input should be given.
	- During my bachelor's, for the C course this was the program I had to write for final practicals evaluation.  Unfortunately those were days I wasn't much interested in programming, and I somehow managed to get the output.  After years of being a sw engg, I thought I must write this program to see how easy it is to write it now.  And hence the program.
